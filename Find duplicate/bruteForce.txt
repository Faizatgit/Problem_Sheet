Approach: 

Sort the array. After that, if there is any duplicate number they will be adjacent.
So we simply have to check if arr[i]==arr[i+1] and if it is true,arr[i] is the duplicate number.

Time Complexity:O(Nlogn + N)

Reason: NlogN for sorting the array and O(N) for traversing through the array and checking if adjacent elements are equal or not. But this will distort the array.

Space Complexity:O(1)
