Approach: 
Take a frequency array of size N+1 and initialize it to 0. Now traverse through the array and if the frequency of the element is 0 increase it by 1,
else if the frequency is not 0 then that element is the required answer.

Time Complexity: O(N), as we are traversing through the array only once.

Space Complexity: O(N), as we are using extra space for frequency array.
