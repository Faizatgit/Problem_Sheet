Approach: variant 1

First, we will use a loop(say i) to select the indices of the array one by one.
For every index i, we will traverse through the remaining array using another loop(say j) 
to find the other number such that the sum is equal to the target (i.e. arr[i] + arr[j] = target).

Time Complexity: O(N2), where N = size of the array.
Reason: There are two loops(i.e. nested) each running for approximately N times.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
