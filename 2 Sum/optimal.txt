Approach:

The steps are the following:

We will sort the given array first.
Now, we will take two pointers i.e. left, which points to the first index, and right, which points to the last index.
Now using a loop we will check the sum of arr[left] and arr[right] until left < right.
If arr[left] + arr[right] > sum, we will decrement the right pointer.
If arr[left] + arr[right] < sum, we will increment the left pointer.
If arr[left] + arr[right] == sum, we will return the result.
Finally, if no results are found we will return “No” or {-1, -1}.

Time Complexity: O(N) + O(N*logN), where N = size of the array.
Reason: The loop will run at most N times. And sorting the array will take N*logN time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
