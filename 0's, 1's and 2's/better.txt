Approach: 

1.Take 3 variables to maintain the count of 0, 1 and 2.
2.Travel the array once and increment the corresponding counting variables
( let’s consider count_0 = a, count_1 = b, count_2 = c )

3. In 2nd traversal of array, we will now over write the first ‘a’ indices / positions in array with ’0’,
   the next ‘b’ with ‘1’ and the remaining ‘c’ with ‘2’.


Time Complexity: O(N) + O(N), where N = size of the array. 
First O(N) for counting the number of 0’s, 1’s, 2’s, and second O(N) for placing them correctly in the original array.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
