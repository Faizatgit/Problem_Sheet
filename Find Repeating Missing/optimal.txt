Approach:
Assume the repeating number to be X and the missing number to be Y.

The steps are as follows:

First, find out the values of S and Sn and then calculate S – Sn (Using the above formulas).
Then, find out the values of S2 and S2n and then calculate S2 – S2n.
After performing steps 1 and 2, we will be having the values of X + Y and X – Y. Now, by substitution of values,
we can easily find the values of X and Y.

Time Complexity: O(N), where N = the size of the given array.
Reason: We are using only one loop running for N times. So, the time complexity will be O(N).

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.
