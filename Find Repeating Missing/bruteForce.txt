Approach:
The steps are as follows:

We will run a loop(say i) from 1 to N.
For each integer, i, we will count its occurrence in the given array using linear search.
We will store those two elements that have the occurrence of 2 and 0.
Finally, we will return the elements.
Note: For a better understanding of intuition, please watch the video at the bottom of the page.

Time Complexity: O(N2), where N = size of the given array.
Reason: Here, we are using nested loops to count occurrences of every element between 1 to N.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
